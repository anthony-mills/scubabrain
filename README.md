## ScubaBrain ##

## Project Intro

This project is a scuba diving related calculator tool. Allowing divers to easily find the maximum operating depth (MOD) and other attributes of various oxygen enriched gases.

## Is it just Nitrox calculations?

No over time the vision is to have all collected sorts of scuba related caclulations.

## Backstory

This project was orginally started by [Anthony Mills](www.anthony-mills) because he got sick of having to try and look up the MOD for 60%+ Nitrox mixes when getting his stage bottle filled. So he decided to build a calculator to use with Ionic Framework. Eventually the project was compiled with [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) for use on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anthony_mills.scubabrain) and IOS app stores.

## Why Release The Codebase?

Anthony is a great believer in the world of Open Source. If other find his code useful or contribute to the code base even better.
